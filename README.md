# ðŸŽ„ Go cover to Treemap

_Useful when you have large project with lots of files and packages_

```
$ go install github.com/nikolaydubina/go-cover-treemap@latest
$ go test -coverprofile cover.out ./...
$ go-cover-heatmap -coverprofile cover.out > out.svg
```

## Disclaimer

In all examples above I run `go test -coverprofile <my-file> ./...`.
I did not do any special setup.
Some projects may reuqire additional steps to properly run tets and generate full coverprofile.
What you see is "lower bound" of coverage for those projects.
All profiles generated on `main` branch of each project in GitHub on 2021-12-07.

## Contributions

Welcomed! Add pretty color palettes! Add interesting examples!

## Appendix A: Assigning size to one for each file

You can see that structure and heat changes for `github.com/gohugoio/hugo`.
Subtrees that look bad for files no longer look as bad for statements.
Lots of red boxes for files become very small and unnoticeable.
This can be because they contain non-testable constructs like constants.
It is more accurate to use statments, since heat is percentage of covered statements, and we compute heat by weighting sum by sizes of children.
In short, you are more likely want to use statements for size.

## Appendix B: Long Roots

It is common to have root and first few children to have only one child.
Each takes margin and wastes space.
We can collapse these into longer name, and use that space for visualizing higher depth of boxes.
This is particularly useful for narrow dimensions, which makes feasible useful narrow dimension.
